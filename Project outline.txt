Project outline:

Determine which movie studios are worst at preventing piracy, and also what features of individual movies predict the degree to which each movie is pirated.

Client: A tech company that offers piracy-prevention services to movie studios.

Client's question: Which major movie studios are doing worst at preventing their movies from being pirated? This info would be useful to us because we can show studios where they stand compared to other studios.

Description of my sample: Pull up to 200 movies for each of the top 50 movie studios by market share.

Characteristics of each movie: Do a search for each of the resulting ~10,000 movies on putlocker.is, which is a site that provides free streaming of pirated movies. If the search hits, mark that movie as pirated.
