###Metis project 2: Predicting movie piracy

To do next:
1. Fix NO_URL_ERRORs:
 *A lot of the time, these are movies that have puntuation in the title. Remove punctuation to align title more with putlocker's url structure. Punctuation is sometimes periods, colons, etc.
 *Some of the time, these are movies that have the year wrong. To fix this, consider checking the url for a year up and a year down.
2. Retrieve piracy data from putlocker.is -- DONE
3. Retrieve more info about each movie from boxofficemojo. Retrieve the following about each:
 *Genre
 *rating
 *production budget
 *director (later, pull length of wiki page)
 *writer (later, pull length of wiki page)
 *actors (later, pull length of wiki page)
 *widest release
4. Retrieve info from wikipedia:
 *director fame
 *writer fame
 *actors' fame
 *movie fame
 *movie 
5. Run descriptive and inferential stats
