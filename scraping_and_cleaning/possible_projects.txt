Proposed project 1: Predicting movie success by actors' characteristics

Client: Medium-large movie studio

Client's question: How can we use an actor's past record to predict the success of movies that the actor is in in the future?

Description of my sample: Pull list of 733 active actors from Boxofficemojo.com.

Characteristics of each actor/director:
1. Number of wins and nominations for awards in the past (also separated by type of award: major vs indie), pulled from imdb or wikipedia. 
2. Has the actor been involved in major controversies? Binary, determined by whether or not there's a "controversies" section on the actor's wiki page.
3. Financial success of past movies (average per film)
4. Number of movies the person has acted in (available on boxofficemojo)
5. Gross of the actor's #1 picture
6. Length of actor's wikipedia page in words (this is a measure of fame but also of how much people care about the person-- there might be v famous people that no one cares to write about)
7. Actor's ethnicity, pulled from wikipedia page by doing a search for ethnicity-related words. I've used this strategy in another project I recently started, here: http://ilyaaltshteyn.com/portfolio/biases-in-grammy-award-winner-selection/

Proposed project 2: Determine which movie studios are worst at preventing piracy.

Client: A tech company that offers piracy-prevention services to movie studios.

Client's question: Which major movie studios are doing worst at preventing their movies from being pirated? This info would be useful to us because we can show studios where they stand compared to other studios.

Description of my sample: Pull up to 200 movies for each of the top 50 movie studios by market share.

Characteristics of each movie: Do a search for each of the resulting ~10,000 movies on putlocker.is, which is a site that provides free streaming of pirated movies. If the search hits, mark that movie as pirated.
