Project outline:

Determine which movies are most likely to be pirated, or the degree to which a given movie is likely to be pirated.

Client: A tech company that offers piracy-prevention services to movie studios.

Client's question: What factors influence the likelihood that a movie will be pirated? This info would be useful to us because we can offer our services to movies that are most likely to be pirated.

Description of my sample: Pull up to 400 movies for each of the top 20 movie studios by market share.

Characteristics of each movie: Do a search for each of the resulting ~10,000 movies on putlocker.is, which is a site that provides free streaming of pirated movies. If the search hits, mark that movie as pirated.
